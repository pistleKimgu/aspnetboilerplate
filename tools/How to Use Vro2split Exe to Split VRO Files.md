However, sometimes you may want to split the VRO file into separate video files, for example, to edit them, to convert them to other formats, or to burn them to DVDs.

## Step 1: Download and Extract Vro2split Exe
 
You can download Vro2split Exe from various online sources. However, be careful to choose a reliable and safe website, as some may contain malware or viruses. One of the websites that you can use is [The Free&Free uploader.jp](https://ux.getuploader.com/2513/download/61), where you can find the Vro2split Exe file along with two other versions of the software.
 
After downloading the Vro2split Exe file, you need to extract it using a zip or rar extractor software. You can use any software that you prefer, such as WinZip, WinRAR, or 7-Zip. Once you extract the file, you will find a folder named vro2split003 or vro2split004, depending on the version you downloaded. Inside the folder, you will find the Vro2split Exe file and a text file that you can delete.
 
## Step 2: Copy Vro2split Exe to the Same Folder as Your VRO File
 
The next step is to copy the Vro2split Exe file to the same folder where your VRO file is located. This is important because the software will automatically detect and split the VRO file in the same folder. If you have multiple VRO files in different folders, you need to copy the Vro2split Exe file to each folder separately.
 
## Step 3: Run Vro2split Exe and Wait for the Splitting Process
 
The final step is to run the Vro2split Exe file by double-clicking on it. A command prompt window will open and show you the progress of the splitting process. The software will scan the VRO file and extract the video streams from it. It will then save them as MPG files in the same folder with names like VR\_MOVIE\_0001.MPG, VR\_MOVIE\_0002.MPG, and so on.
 
The splitting process may take some time depending on the size and number of video streams in your VRO file. You can check the status of the process by looking at the command prompt window or by checking the size of the MPG files in your folder. When the process is finished, the command prompt window will close automatically and you will have your split video files ready for use.
