If you are looking for a way to get free AC in AQW, you might be tempted to download a cheat or a hack that promises to give you unlimited AC. However, this is not a good idea for several reasons. First of all, downloading any cheat or hack from an unknown source can be dangerous for your computer and your account. You might end up with a virus, malware, or spyware that can harm your system or steal your personal information. You might also get banned from AQW if the cheat or hack is detected by the game's anti-cheat system.
 
Secondly, most of the cheats or hacks that claim to give you free AC are fake or outdated. They might not work at all, or they might only work for a short time before they stop working or get patched by the game developers. You might waste your time and effort trying to find a working cheat or hack, only to be disappointed or frustrated.
 
So, what is the best way to get free AC in AQW? The answer is simple: earn them legitimately. There are several ways to earn free AC in AQW without cheating or hacking. Here are some of them:
 
- Ballyhoo: Ballyhoo is a character in Battleon who shows you ads and offers from sponsors. You can watch one ad or offer per day and get 5 AC as a reward. This is an easy and safe way to get some free AC every day.
- AExtras: AExtras is a feature on the AQW website that lets you complete surveys, watch videos, play games, and do other tasks from third-party providers. You can earn free AC by doing these tasks, but you need to be careful and read the terms and conditions of each offer before you accept it. Some offers might require you to pay money, give personal information, or download something. You should also use a valid email address and check your spam folder for confirmation emails.
- Special Codes: Sometimes, the game developers release special codes that can be redeemed for free items or AC. These codes are usually announced on the game's official website, social media pages, newsletters, or events. You can enter these codes by talking to Valencia in Battleon and choosing "Special Codes". Some examples of past codes are Oicu812 (for a sword), Thirteen1 (for a helmet), and Dragonkhan8234280 (for a shop).

These are some of the legitimate ways to get free AC in AQW without cheating or hacking. By following these methods, you can enjoy the game without risking your account or your computer. Remember, cheating is not fun and not fair. Play AQW the right way and have fun!
